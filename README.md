- KitchenInterface.tsx: Central state hub, view routing
- services/api.ts: Database abstraction with mock fallback
```

### Data Flow

```
User Action
    ↓
Component Event Handler
    ↓
State Setter Function (passed via props)
    ↓
KitchenInterface State Update
    ↓
Re-render Affected Components
    ↓
(Optional) API Call to Persist
    ↓
Supabase Database Update
```

### State Management Pattern

ChefStack uses **explicit prop drilling** (no Context API):

**Why?**
- ✅ Explicit dependencies - easy to trace data flow
- ✅ No hidden global state
- ✅ Refactoring safety - TypeScript catches all usage
- ✅ Performance - only affected components re-render
- ❌ Verbose - many props per component

**Example**:
```tsx
// App.tsx fetches all data
const [recipes, setRecipes] = useState<Recipe[]>([]);

// Pass to KitchenInterface
<KitchenInterface 
  recipes={recipes} 
  setRecipes={setRecipes}
  // ... 40+ more props
/>

// KitchenInterface filters and passes to views
<RecipeList
  recipes={teamRecipes}
  onEdit={(recipe) => setRecipes(prev => prev.map(...))}
  onDelete={(id) => setRecipes(prev => prev.filter(...))}
/>
```

### Database Schema

Supabase tables (PostgreSQL):

**Core Tables**:
- `users` - User accounts
- `teams` - Kitchen teams/organizations
- `team_members` - User-team relationships
- `recipes` - Recipe data
- `ingredient_costs` - Cost database
- `inventory_items` - Stock items
- `inventory_locations` - Storage locations
- `inventory_transactions` - Stock movements
- `waste_logs` - Waste entries
- `menus` - Menu definitions
- `haccp_logs` - Temperature/safety logs
- `haccp_items` - Critical control points
- `suppliers` - Supplier profiles
- `workstations` - Prep stations
- `prep_tasks` - Task assignments
- `shifts` - Staff shifts
- `shift_schedules` - Shift planning
- `notifications` - System notifications
- `messages` - Chat messages
- `channels` - Chat channels

**Naming Conventions**:
- Tables: `snake_case` plural
- Columns: `snake_case`
- Foreign keys: `{table}_id`

**Mappers**: Automatic camelCase ↔ snake_case conversion in `api.ts`

## 💻 Development

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Adding a New Feature View

1. **Define View Type** (`types.ts`):
```tsx
export type View = '...' | 'my_new_feature';
```

2. **Create Component** (`components/myfeature/MyFeatureView.tsx`):
```tsx
interface MyFeatureViewProps {
  data: Entity[];
  setData: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<Entity[]>>;
  currentTeamId: string;
  // ... other required props
}

const MyFeatureView: React.FC<MyFeatureViewProps> = ({
  data, setData, currentTeamId
}) => {
  // Local UI state
  const [isFormOpen, setIsFormOpen] = useState(false);
  
  // Render view
  return <div>...</div>;
};
```

3. **Route in KitchenInterface** (`KitchenInterface.tsx`):
```tsx
case 'my_new_feature':
  return <MyFeatureView 
    data={data} 
    setData={setData} 
    currentTeamId={currentTeamId}
  />;
```

4. **Add Translation Keys** (`i18n.ts`):
```tsx
el: {
  nav_my_feature: 'Το Feature μου',
  // ...
},
en: {
  nav_my_feature: 'My Feature',
  // ...
}
```

### CRUD Operations Pattern

**Create**:
```tsx
const newEntity = {
  id: `${Date.now()}`,
  ...formData,
  teamId: currentTeamId
};
setData(prev => [...prev, newEntity]);
```

**Update**:
```tsx
setData(prev => prev.map(e => 
  e.id === entity.id ? { ...e, ...changes } : e
));
```

**Delete**:
```tsx
setData(prev => prev.filter(e => e.id !== entityId));
```

### Form Component Pattern

```tsx
interface FormProps {
  toEdit?: Entity | null;
  onSave: (entity: Entity | Omit<Entity, 'id'>) => void;
  onCancel: () => void;
}

const EntityForm: React.FC<FormProps> = ({ toEdit, onSave, onCancel }) => {
  const [entity, setEntity] = useState(toEdit || initialState);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    setEntity(toEdit || initialState);
  }, [toEdit]);
  
  const handleSubmit = () => {
    onSave(entity);
  };
  
  return <form>...</form>;
};
```

### Using AI Features

All AI features use the `withApiKeyCheck` pattern:

```tsx
interface MyViewProps {
  withApiKeyCheck: (action: () => void) => void;
}

const MyView: React.FC<MyViewProps> = ({ withApiKeyCheck }) => {
  const handleAIFeature = () => {
    withApiKeyCheck(async () => {
      const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY;
      if (!apiKey) throw new Error('Missing API key');
      
      // Call Gemini API
      const response = await fetch(
        `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=${apiKey}`,
        {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            contents: [{ parts: [{ text: prompt }] }]
          })
        }
      );
      
      // Process response
    });
  };
};
```

### Environment Variables

**Critical**: Use `import.meta.env.VITE_*`, NOT `process.env`

```tsx
// ✅ Correct
const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY;

// ❌ Wrong (won't work in Vite)
const apiKey = process.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY;
```

### Bilingual Entity Fields

Always pair `name` (Greek) and `name_en` (English):

```tsx
interface Recipe {
  name: string;      // Greek - required
  name_en: string;   // English - required
}

// Forms: provide both inputs
<input 
  placeholder="Όνομα (Ελληνικά)"
  value={recipe.name}
  onChange={e => setRecipe({...recipe, name: e.target.value})}
/>
<input 
  placeholder="Name (English)"
  value={recipe.name_en}
  onChange={e => setRecipe({...recipe, name_en: e.target.value})}
/>

// Display: choose based on language
{language === 'el' ? recipe.name : recipe.name_en}
```

### Allergen Handling

```tsx
import { ALLERGENS_LIST, ALLERGEN_TRANSLATIONS } from './types';
import { AllergenIcon } from './components/common/AllergenIcon';

// Checkboxes
{ALLERGENS_LIST.map(allergen => (
  <label key={allergen}>
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      checked={selectedAllergens.includes(allergen)}
      onChange={e => {
        if (e.target.checked) {
          setSelectedAllergens([...selectedAllergens, allergen]);
        } else {
          setSelectedAllergens(selectedAllergens.filter(a => a !== allergen));
        }
      }}
    />
    {ALLERGEN_TRANSLATIONS[allergen][language]}
  </label>
))}

// Display icons
{selectedAllergens.map(allergen => (
  <AllergenIcon key={allergen} allergen={allergen} />
))}
```

## 📚 API Reference

### Service Layer (`services/api.ts`)

#### Data Fetching

```tsx
// Fetch all data at once
const data = await api.fetchAllData();
// Returns: { users, teams, recipes, inventory, ... }

// Individual entity fetches
const recipes = await api.fetchRecipes(teamId);
const inventory = await api.fetchInventory(teamId);
const menus = await api.fetchMenus(teamId);
```

#### CRUD Operations

```tsx
// Create
const newRecipe = await api.createRecipe(recipeData);

// Update
const updated = await api.updateRecipe(recipeId, changes);

// Delete
await api.deleteRecipe(recipeId);

// Upsert (create or update)
const saved = await api.upsertRecipe(recipe);
```

#### Authentication

```tsx
// Sign up
const user = await api.signUp(email, password, name);

// Sign in
const session = await api.signIn(email, password);

// Sign out
await api.signOut();

// Get current user
const { user, teams } = await api.getCurrentUserAndTeams();
```

#### Special Operations

```tsx
// Inventory transaction
await api.createInventoryTransaction({
  itemId,
  quantity,
  type: 'in' | 'out' | 'transfer',
  locationId,
  // ...
});

// Transfer stock
await api.transferStock(itemId, fromLocationId, toLocationId, quantity);

// Import invoice
const items = await api.extractInvoiceItems(file);
```

### Translation Hook

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from './i18n';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { t, language } = useTranslation();
  
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{t('nav_recipes')}</h1>
      <p>Current language: {language}</p>
    </>
  );
};
```

### LocalStorage Hook

```tsx
import { useLocalStorage } from './hooks/useLocalStorage';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [preference, setPreference] = useLocalStorage('myKey', 'defaultValue');
  
  // Works like useState but persists to localStorage
  return <button onClick={() => setPreference('newValue')}>Save</button>;
};
```
